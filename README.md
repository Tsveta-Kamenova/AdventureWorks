# AdventureWorks Power BI Project

This project was built as part of the Power BI Desktop Course by Maven Analytics.  
It simulates the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst at AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company.  

The goal: transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Project Workflow

The project followed the key stages of the Business Intelligence lifecycle:

### Stage 1: Data Preparation
- Connected to multiple data sources (Excel, database, web).
- Performed ETL using Power Query:
  - Cleaned and transformed tables  
  - Created calculated and conditional columns  
  - Merged and appended queries  
  - Built rolling calendars  

### Stage 2: Data Modeling
- Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables.
- Defined relationships (primary and foreign keys).
- Applied data categories, hierarchies, and model layouts.

### Stage 3: DAX Calculations
- Created calculated columns and measures.  
- Implemented KPI metrics like Total Sales, Profit Margin, and Year-over-Year Growth.  
- Used time intelligence functions for rolling totals and comparisons.  
- Leveraged iterators (X-functions) and CALCULATE/FILTER patterns.

### Stage 4: Visualization and Reporting
- Built an interactive dashboard with:
  - Cards and KPI indicators  
  - Matrix and chart visuals  
  - Drillthrough, bookmarks and slicers  
  - Conditional formatting and tooltips  
- Designed a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.  
- Configured Role-Level Security (RLS) for regional managers.
